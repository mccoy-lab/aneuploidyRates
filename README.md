### Folders

The main data files supporting the paper are: 

- **08-16c, 08-16d, 08-16e**  
  Contains 3000 ABC_seq Lenormand data for [**Viotti**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.11.041).

- **08-29**  
  Includes misdiagnosed rates applied to expected values with dispersal levels of 0, 0.5, and 1.

- **08-30**  
  Contains generated embryos based on distributions from `08-29`.

The same procedure has been carried out in other literature data. Below is an updating
list of these data files:
